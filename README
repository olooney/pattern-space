This is a small C++ "game" I wrote in C++ when I was first learning design 
patterns. I've come a long way since then but I think it holds up pretty
well; in any case it's largest C++ program I've written that I unambiguously
own the copyrights to. It does pretty well with interface segregation,
decorator chains, etc., but if I was still working on it I would clean up the 
loading/initialization process and decouple the reusable engine classes from 
the specific classes and data of the game.

It compiles on Linux if you include SDL and SDL_gfx
and probably still compiles on Windows, although I haven't tried it there
recently.
